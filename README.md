## About this project

I have worked on this project for about 3 months. It is quite enjoyable, but also time consuming. I made two working keyboards, one bluetooth and one wireless. The feel of the layout is fantastic! Even if my keyboards are working, it's not ready for other people to build. I hope to have time to continue this project, but I can't make promises to anyone.

## Other Projects to Check Out

The [Totem](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM) keyboard. The Totem was the inspiration for this keyboard. I have huge respect for the creator of this project. The creator really put a lot of effort into making a great finished project.


## Case

The case uses a tenting system that I have used for a year. It's not perfect, but every-time I think of switching to a different design I can't find justification. The advantage is of my tenting system is that it is very stable and very adjustable. My tenting system is not portable, meaning it will probably break if you put it in a bag and ride the subway.

The case was designed using onshape and you can find a link to it [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5c5e04ae1784123d6189c14c/w/86f29d74e9109abb974cb649/e/b3c51a35815c88e0a251e0eb?renderMode=0&uiState=679c96c15b955f7398b0b3b0)
