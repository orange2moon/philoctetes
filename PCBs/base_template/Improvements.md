# Improvements

## Most important thing, ergonomics
- [x] adjust the ring finger column
    - It needs to come up a little
- [x] adjust the pinky finger column
    - the outer column needs to come up a little
    - the two pinky columns were moved outward a little

middle -> ring vertical space = 7.8 mm or 7.9 

## Mechanical improvements
- Change the footprints of the diodes
- [x] adjust the spacing of individual keys
    - The center is the middle finger, everything else moves around it
    

- Make room for a bigger battery
    - I could make a cutout under the mcu, this would give more
    clearance for a battery, also moving the display mount down would
    help a lot

## Things I wouldn't change
- The capacitors are great
    - add a bigger one, or two of the electrolytic capacitors, or one
    big through hole electrolytic and bend the wires over so it sits
    horizontally 

What is the spacing between keys vertically?
According to the corne project... it looks to be 19.05 mm 
This seems correct. The distance in my build was 18.13 and it seemed to
be about 1 mm or more too close.
